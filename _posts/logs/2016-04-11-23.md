- [通往写作的路径](http://www.jiemian.com/article/472374.html)

	> 在我的人生中，在感性和智识上脱胎换骨成长的阶段，并不是在普林斯顿大学或牛津大学。它们当然都是很棒的大学，尤其我还幸运地遇到像麦克菲这样优秀的写作老师。但这仍然不是我作家训练中最重要的部分。让我收获最多的地方，是涪陵。

	> 离开家。离开你的家庭，离开你熟悉的日常，离开你舒适的社交圈。花时间跟与你不同的人在一起。学着去观察、思考和描述其他人，而不仅仅只是写你自己。

	最初是从「[单读](http://www.owspace.com/#read)」的音频节目中听到了这篇文章，来回听了两边，又找来原文看了一遍。又想起 [Why I Write](http://www.whyiwrite.net/) 这个网站，看了[何伟写的](http://www.whyiwrite.net/2012/12/peter-hessler/)，以下也是一些摘抄：

	> In the village outside of Beijing where I have a home, I was once helping a neighbor kid with his homework, and his assignment was: “Write an essay about your lamp.” He wrote “My lamp is very bright,” and then he got stuck. Well, that’s another bright kid who probably won’t be writing novels in 20 years. Or if he does, it’ll be a 600-page allegory about a light bulb.

	> Personally, I’m more engaged by Chinese film. I think that during the past two decades that medium has produced more work of quality than any other Chinese art. It makes sense – the Communist system established a lot of well-funded film schools, and regardless of politics those places teach important technical skills. And film is something of a collaborative art, so it might be more compatible with what people learn in the Chinese education system. It’s also easier to understand film in translation, so Chinese film students can educate themselves by watching foreign movies. They learn the technical stuff in the state-run schools, and they figure out the more creative skills on their own.

	> People want to get involved, and they want to change the world, but they don’t want to be patient. And they aren’t inclined to grant others the dignity of figuring out their own path.

	> Plenty of other people are trying to change the world, often in heavy-handed ways that do as much harm as good.

	> 软弱没什么不好，它恰好是我们当初走到一起的理由。因为软弱，我们相互依赖，我们从内心深处需要对方，希冀对方对自己好一点，同时我们又知道自己对这一切无能为力，随时朝不保夕。我们还知道，同样的感觉对方也有，与自己一模一样。
